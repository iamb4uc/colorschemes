# The colorscheme-repo
***This is a repository of all the color-schemes I used on a daily basis, this helps me spend less time in finding the appropriate color for each of my css, linux rice, and many other stuffs where I need them.***


The formating of these colors are usually simple but I try to keep everything simple and easy to understand, you can just copy the text or just download the file for quick reference for you next r/unixporn rice or you fancy bloated css rich website i suppose.
